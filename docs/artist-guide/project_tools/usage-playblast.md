# Playblast Shot

Once your first shot is animated, you are ready to render a playblast of this shot, which will later be imported into your edit .blend file.

1. Open your shot .blend file by navigating to `Project > Open Shot`.
<div style="padding: 12px; background: var(--color-bg-secondary, transparent); border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <img src="/media/artist-guide/project_tools/invoke_open_shot.jpg" width="600" alt="Invoke Open Shot" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
</div>

2. In the Kitsu Sidepanel, under Playblast Tools, you are now ready to create a new playblast version. Select `Create Playblast`, which will render a preview of your shot and add it as a comment on your Kitsu Task for this shot:
	1. **Status:** Select the status to set your Kitsu Task to.
	2. **Comment:** Add any notes you would like to include in your comment.
	3. **Use Current Viewport Shading:** Enable this to render with the settings from your current viewport.
	4. **Thumbnail Frame:** Choose which frame in your current file should be the thumbnail for your preview file.

<div style="padding: 12px; background: var(--color-bg-secondary, transparent); border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <img src="/media/artist-guide/project_tools/draw_playblast.jpg" width="600" alt="Draw Playblast" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
</div>

::: info Version Management
If you are using version control software, it is recommended to create a new commit at the time of playblast. If you are not using version control software, a disk version will be automatically created at the time of playblast. This is configured by the [Setup Assistant](/td-guide/setup_assistant) and is based on your [Kitsu Preferences](/td-guide/addon_preferences).
