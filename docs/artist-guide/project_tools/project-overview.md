# Project Overview

## Introduction
"Project Tools" is a collection of scripts included in the [Blender Studio Pipeline](https://projects.blender.org/studio/blender-studio-tools) repository, developed to assist you in running and managing one or more projects. These scripts automate and standardize many common operations involved in setting up a production pipeline.

It all starts with the directory layout, which should be deployed by a Technical Director following the [Project Tools Setup Guide](/td-guide/introduction.md). This standard directory layout defines where things like `.blend` files and playblasts are stored. It enables Project Tools to ensure all users are running the same version of Blender and have a similar experience with minimal setup required by individual users.
