# Deployment Assistant

The `deployment_assistant.py` script finalizes your Blender Studio Tools project after initial setup with `setup_assistant.py`. It configures Blender, installs extensions, and prepares the project for artists.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What Does the Script Do?

- **Updates extensions**  
  Ensures the latest add-ons are installed for your project.

- **Configures Blender**  
  Sets up Blender with the correct version and preferences.

- **Saves Kitsu credentials**  
  Stores login info for seamless artist experience.

- **Creates desktop shortcut**  
  (Linux only) Adds a launcher for easy project access.


## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Navigate to the tools directory**  
   - **Linux/Mac:**  
     ```bash
     cd ~/data/your_project_name/svn/tools
     ./deployment_assistant.py
     ```
   - **Windows:**  
     ```bash
     cd %HOMEPATH%\data\your_project_name\svn\tools
     python deployment_assistant.py
     ```

2. **Follow the prompts**  
   The script will guide you through the deployment steps.
