# Storyboard

## General requirements

* The script of the film
* Sequence Briefing from the director
* Concept art and character designs

## Goal of the task

Storyboarding is the first step into visualizing the vision of the director.

This is the time to
- try different angles,
- beats,
-  acting choices
to determine the storytelling in visual format.

The goal is to create a version of the movie that eliminates as many alternative possibilities as possible and is solid enough to be transferred to the next stage: Previz.

## Storyboarding using Story Pencil

For the workflow of storyboarding we use the Grease Pencil tool combined with the Story Pencil addon.

The advantage of this workflow is the **possibility to combine 2D drawings within a 3d environment** which allows us to use 3d environment as a base to create spacial awareness from the beginning that can be used in modeling/previz as a point of reference.

The Story Pencil addon allows us to **use the VSE editor** in Blender and swap easily between shots and edit, or alter different shots.

## Workflow

To start, we have been using rough sketches to simply **convey the idea** and **progression** of each shot. A first pass will be shown to the director and any feedback will be addressed.

Once a version is approved by the director, we'll continue to **refine** the drawings and add more definition to the shot by using a **2 color shading method**.

As an initial edit pass with Story Pencil, once we finalize a sequence, the drawings will be exported to individual images for the editorial department. They can use these images to refine the timing and adjust composition to the drawings if needed.
