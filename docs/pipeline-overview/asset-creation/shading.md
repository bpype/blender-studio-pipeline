## Requirements
* Reference (Concepts, Material)
* Base Models for tests/ Final Topology for task
* Topology requirements
* Required LOD

## Initial Choices

### Rendering Style Choice (PBR vs NPR)
* General shading model

### Engine Choice (Cycles vs Eevee)
* Eevee shading settings
* Cycles shader displacement
* Hybrid workflow

### Workflow Choice (Procedural vs Data) 
* Ups and Downs
* Texture specs and color management
* Semi-procedural

### Coordinate space (UV vs 3D)	
* Deformation
* Procedurals

## Workflow

### Data Layers
* UVs
* Vcols
* Attributes

### Texture Baking
* HiRes to LowRes
* Procedural to texture
* Pattern baking

### Node Group Structure (modularity)
* Main shader
* Utility node groups

### External Control (Custom Properties)

### Shading Data Generation
* Geonodes
