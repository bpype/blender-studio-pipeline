# Lattice Magic

Lattice Magic is an add-on that adds two lattice-based deformation tools to Blender; The first one lets you smear meshes in an area of influence, and the other lets you deform them using a camera-space grid.

You can find the documentation [here](https://studio.blender.org/tools/addons/lattice_magic).
