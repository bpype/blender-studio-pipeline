# Pose Shape Keys

This add-on enables a workflow where you can think of shape keys as a final shape rather than as deltas on some deformation. This means you can continue iterating on your vertex weights and bone constraints after you've already created your shape keys, without having to re-sculpt those shape keys.

You can find the documentation [here](https://studio.blender.org/pipeline/addons/pose_shape_keys).
