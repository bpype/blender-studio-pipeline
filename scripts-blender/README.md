# Blender Studio Add-ons

This is a list of all add-ons developed in-house by the Blender Studio. You can report issues [here](https://projects.blender.org/studio/blender-studio-tools/issues).

### Installation

Some of the add-ons [can be found on the Extensions Platform](https://extensions.blender.org/team/blender-studio/) already, others will arrive over time. For these add-ons, you can simply search for them inside Blender, under "Get Extensions" in the user preferences.

To install add-ons which are not there, follow these steps:
1. Download and unzip this repository from [this link](https://projects.blender.org/studio/blender-studio-tools/archive/main.zip).
2. In Blender, navigate to Preferences->File Paths->Script Directories.
3. Add an entry, and browse the `scripts-blender` folder. (Not the `addons` folder!)
4. Done, you can now enable any of our add-ons.
