# Blender Studio Add-ons

This is a list of all add-ons developed in-house by the Blender Studio. You can report issues [here](https://projects.blender.org/studio/blender-studio-pipeline/issues).

### Installation

It is easiest to install all our add-ons at once rather than one at a time:
1. Download the latest release from the [Releases Page](https://projects.blender.org/studio/blender-studio-pipeline/releases).
2. Create this folder structure: `Blender Studio/addons/`.
3. Unzip what you downloaded into the `addons` folder.
4. In Blender, navigate to Preferences->File Paths->Script Directories.
5. Add an entry, and browse the `Blender Studio` folder. (Not the `addons` folder!)
6. Done, you can now enable any of our add-ons.
