          Thank you for wanting to submit a report and help me improve CloudRig.  

          ### Please provide a .blend file with bug reports.  
          If your issue is about a metarig that fails to generate, please use the "Report Bug" button in the interface:  
          Select your metarig and go to Properties->Object Data->CloudRig->Generation Log, and click on "Report Bug".

          ### Please make sure you use the CloudRig version that corresponds to your Blender version.
